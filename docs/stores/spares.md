# Spares

::: tip
Traceability is important with spares. Read [Traceability](/stores/#traceability)
:::

This module deals with items that will be installed onto components and have part numbers and possibly serial numbers. Spares include nuts, bolts, o-rings (packings), but do not include grease, paint, oil or lube.
