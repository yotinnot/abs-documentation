# IDs

## What is an ID?

An ID is a unique identifier for an item. It is used to identify the item in the database and is usually used as a primary key in the database.

## Types of IDs

### Runnings IDs

Running IDs or running numbers are the most basic type of IDs. They are created by the system from either a starting number or the last number in the database and incremented by 1 for each new item.

This type of IDs can be incremented based on month or year (optionally) and is useful for items that needs to be printed on paper, such as invoices, receipts, ARCs.

### Unique IDs

UUIDs, sometimes called GUIDs, are unique identifiers that are generated by the system. They are 128-bit numbers that are guaranteed to be unique across space and time. They are useful for items that are not printed on paper, such as users, products, etc.

UUIDs are particularly useful for items that are stored across multiple databases, so that each database does not need to keep track of the IDs of the items in the other databases.

UUIDs can come in many different formats, such as:

- `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` (default)
- `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` (RFC 4122)
